# Dolos-web

Dolos visualisation in your browser using. Please see the [@dodona/dolos](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dodona/dolos) package for more information.

### Development

The web interface uses [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

This repository uses [yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/)
so it is recommended to use yarn (especially if you want to develop the `cli`
project as well).

- Run `yarn install` in the **root directory**, this will link the `web` project
  with the `cli` project as well.
- Run `yarn dev` to serve a development version which reloads and rebuilds as you make changes.
- Build the project (for production) with `yarn build`
